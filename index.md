## Favorite CPSC-120L Labs (2024)

* Lab 12

  In this lab, it was enjoyable due to the concepts that we used. It was a great lab to use all the concepts and functions we have learned over the semester. In part 1, we created a gradient with various amounts of color using the MagickColor API. In part 2, we created a coin flip system using a random number generator. This lab was very satisfying to complete and end the semester off on. 

* Lab 3 

  This lab was pivotal for the rest of my lab in this class, due to this lab introducing the “make” commands. Which at first was very difficult for me to use but after I got the hang of it, it was something that I enjoyed very much. This lab only had 1 part to it, It was a lab based on calculating the BMR (basal metabolic rate) and we used arithmetic operators inorder to calculate. 

* Lab 8 

  Now this lab was my favorite due to the fact that we got to use for loops. This is something that intrigued me a lot. In this lab there were 2 parts, the first part is creating a judge that takes an assigned score, and with loops, it takes out the lowest score and the greatest score and then, creates an average with the remaining scores. Then part 2 uses a for loop to create a gradient with dashes, asterisk, and bars.
